          <h2>Keeping Doctors, Nurses, and You <em>Healthy</em></h2>
          <p>As technology has advanced, healthcare providers utilize tablets, smartphones, and other devices more and more. As doctors and nurses move from room to room, itâ€™s not hard to imagine the spread of germs and bacteria. Likewise, every individual entering a healthcare facility brings with them germs from the outside. PhoneSoap offers simple, effective solutions that allow doctors, nurses, patients, and visitors a way to completely cut off the spread of phone-borne illness. PhoneSoap products have been used in nursing stations, waiting rooms, and NICUs, and we hope to serve your facility as well.</p>

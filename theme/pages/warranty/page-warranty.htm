Product must be returned in original packaging and in new condition. Buyer is required to pay all return shipping costs and register their return package with a tracking number. Your receipt is required with your return as well as a Return Merchandise Authorization Number (RMA #). You will be credited for the cost of the item(s) and any applicable tax minus actual shipping costs. Shipping will not be refunded. For returns, exchanges, and defects contact customer service for a RMA # through live chat or at <a href="mailto:cs@phonesoap.com" target="_blank">cs@phonesoap.com</a>.</p>

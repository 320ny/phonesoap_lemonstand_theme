          <h1>Charge &amp; Sanitize Your iPhone 6 / 6s</h1>
          <p class="enhanced">PhoneSoap Charger is the best way to charge, clean and sanitize an iPhone 6. It was designed with enough space to fit and sanitize the new, larger iPhone 6.</p>

          <p>PhoneSoap Charger was engineered with a compartment containing a standard USB port. You can open this up, unplug the shipped Micro USB cord, and plug in Apple’s Lightning cord. You can store the cord in the compartment and charge your device in the sanitizing space.</p>
          <p>Measure your device (with or without a case) to ensure it will fit inside PhoneSoap Charger’s sanitizing space:</p>

          <p>Millimeters: 173 L X 95 W X 20 H
          <br>Inches: 6.8 L x 3.74 W x .78 H</p>

          <h1>Charge &amp; Sanitize Your HTC Phone</h1>
          <p class="enhanced">PhoneSoap Charger is the best way to charge, clean and sanitize an HTC device. It was designed with enough space to fit and sanitize most all HTC phones, including the HTC One.</p>

          <p>PhoneSoap Charger ships with a Micro USB cord to allow you to charge your phone inside. If your HTC device uses a different cable to charge, PhoneSoap Charger was engineered with a compartment containing a standard USB port where you can plug in the cord that came with your phone. You can open up the compartment, unplug the shipped Micro USB cord, and plug in your charging cord. You can store your cord in the compartment and charge your device in the sanitizing space.</p>

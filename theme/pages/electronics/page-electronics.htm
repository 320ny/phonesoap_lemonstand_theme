          <h1>Charge &amp; Sanitize Your Electronic Devices</h1>
          <p class="enhanced">PhoneSoap Charger is the best way to charge, clean and sanitize all electronics. If your electronic device fits inside, it will be safely sanitized. Whether it is a camera, an iPod or even a pacifier. Check out the dimensions below to confirm your device fits.</p>

          <p>Further, PhoneSoap Charger ships with a Micro USB cord to allow you to charge any device that charges through USB input. If your device uses a different cable to charge, PhoneSoap Charger was engineered with a compartment containing a standard USB port where you can plug in the cord that came with your device. You can open up the compartment, unplug the shipped Micro USB cord, and plug in your charging cord. You can store your cord in the compartment and charge your device in the sanitizing space.</p>
          
          <p>Measure your device (with or without a case) to ensure it will fit inside PhoneSoap Chargerâ€™s sanitizing space:</p>

          <p>Millimeters: 173 L X 95 W X 20 H<br>Inches: 6.8 L x 3.74 W x .78 H</p>

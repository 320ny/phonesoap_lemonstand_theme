          <h1>Charge &amp; Sanitize Your iPhone</h1>
          <p class="enhanced">PhoneSoap Charger is the best way to charge, clean and sanitize an iPhone. It was designed with enough space to fit and sanitize all versions of the iPhone (including with most all cases – such as an Otterbox or Mophie Pack).</p>

          <p>PhoneSoap Charger was engineered with a compartment containing a standard USB port to charge your device inside. You can open up the compartment, unplug the shipped Micro USB cord, and plug in your Apple cord. Whether you have a 30-pin or a Lightning cord, you can plug into the USB port, store the cord in the compartment and charge your device.</p>
          
          <p>Measure your device (with or without a case) to ensure it will fit inside PhoneSoap Charger’s sanitizing space:</p>

          <p>Millimeters: 153 L X 95 W X 20 H<br>Inches: 6 L x 3.74 W x .78 H</p>

          <strong>PHONESOAP POLISH</strong>
          <p>PhoneSoap Polish is compatible with ALL smooth screen displays. Have a smooth screen protector? Great, you can polish that too and benefit with the same non-greasy, shiny finish. DO NOT use on textured screens or textured screen protectors.</p>

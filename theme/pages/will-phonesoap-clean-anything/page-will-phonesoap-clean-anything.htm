          <p>PhoneSoap was made with phones in mind (hence the name!). But we want to make it clear that PhoneSoap is safe for any product you want to sanitize. If it fits inside, it can be safely cleaned! Check out PhoneSoaps Charger's specifications page to see the inner dimensions to find out what can fit inside.</p>

        <p class="enhanced">Charge any USB enabled device.</p>
        <p>While PhoneSoap was designed to charge phones, it will clean whatever you put inside, even if it doesn't need a charge. Further, if you are putting in a device other than a phone (a point and shoot camera, an iPod) that charges through USB, you can charge it inside PhoneSoap.</p>

          <h1>Phones With Cases</h1>
          <p class="enhanced">Should you leave your case on when using PhoneSoap Charger? Of course! The charger was designed to accommodate your case. The parts of the phone that you always touch are the parts that you want clean, so leave that case on!</p>

          <p>PhoneSoap Charger was designed in such a way to fit almost all cases. If you constantly use your phone with a case on, it is important to clean both the phone and the case. We suggest you take your case off once a month and sanitize both separately. On all other occasions you can clean your phone while inside your case.</p>

          <p>PhoneSoap Charger's inner dimensions (where you will place your phone to be sanitized and charged) are 153mm (6 inches) in length x 95mm (3.74 inches) in width x 21.5mm (.84 inches) in height. Measure your case to confirm that your phone and case will fit inside.</p>

          <p>A few years back, while watching TV, we saw a shocking report. We learned that our cell phones are contaminated with fecal matter. Knowing how often our phones visit the restroom with us, it did not surprise us! While we didn’t consider ourselves complete germaphobes (okay, maybe a little), we knew we had to fix this.</p>

          <p>We first set to disprove what we had heard. We felt that there was no way the average phone was that dirty! While searching online and testing phones, the bad news continued to stack up. We discovered that our cell phones are full of living bacteria. All phones are dirty, but especially our new smart phones. They are always being used, we are touching them and we are letting others borrow our phones to make a call or use our apps. To make it worse, our phones are warm, and we store them in warm places. This causes our phones to become a breeding ground for germs. We discovered that whether or not you had fecal matter on your phone, it was still full of bacteria. The average phone is 18X dirtier than a male public toilet. There are thousands of harmful, living germs on our cell phones.</p>

          <p>We set out on a mission to clean up our phones. We realized that as our phones become "smarter" and more touch centric, this problem was only going to get worse. Plus, as much as anything, we wanted to find a way to continue to use our phones without having to change our habits. We love using our phones, but we don't love germs. We didn’t want to pass our sicknesses onto anyone else and we would sure love it if everyone else did the same. While some germs can be beneficial, and we can’t eliminate all germs, we knew we should eliminate the largest and worst offender (our cell phones). Our dirty phones are the number one culprits of harmful germs and bacteria. If you think it’s important to clean your hands, then you need to clean your phone. And this is why we made PhoneSoap!</p>

          <p>We wanted to make a product that would solve the problem, but do so in a way that would not add to our daily routines or take us away from our phones (we love having our phones on body). We truly made a product that we love using. Every night while we sleep, PhoneSoap cleans our phones as they charge. We love using PhoneSoap and we know that you will too!</p>

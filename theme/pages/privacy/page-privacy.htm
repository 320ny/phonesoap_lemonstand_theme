        <strong>WARRANTY COVERAGE</strong>
        <p>PhoneSoap’s warranty obligations are limited to the terms set forth below: PhoneSoap, as defined below, warrants PhoneSoap-branded hardware products against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use to the original end-user purchaser for the Warranty Period. If a hardware defect arises and a valid claim is received within the Warranty Period, at its option, PhoneSoap will either (1) repair the hardware defect at no charge, using new or refurbished replacement parts, or (2) exchange the product with a product that is new or which has been manufactured from new or serviceable used parts and is at least functionally equivalent to the original product, or (3) refund the purchase price of the product. PhoneSoap may request that you replace defective parts with new or refurbished user-installable parts that PhoneSoap provides in fulfillment of its warranty obligation. A replacement product or part, including a user-installable part that has been installed in accordance with instructions provided by PhoneSoap, assumes the remaining warranty of the original product or thirty (30) days from the date of replacement or repair, whichever provides longer coverage for you. When a product or part is exchanged, any replacement item becomes your property and the replaced item becomes PhoneSoap’s property. Parts provided by PhoneSoap in fulfillment of its warranty obligation must be used in products for which warranty service is claimed. When a refund is given, the product for which the refund is provided must be returned to PhoneSoap and becomes PhoneSoap’s property.</p>

        <strong>EXCLUSIONS &amp; LIMITATIONS</strong>
        <p>PhoneSoap does not warrant that the operation of the product will be uninterrupted or error-free. PhoneSoap is not responsible for damage arising from failure to follow instructions relating to the product’s use. For warranty periods over 6 months, you will be responsible for shipping charges to and from PhoneSoap, or PhoneSoap's designee.</p>
        <p>This warranty does not apply: (a) to damage caused by use with non-PhoneSoap products; (b) to damage caused by accident, abuse, misuse, flood, fire, earthquake or other external causes; (c) to damage caused by operating the product outside the permitted or intended uses described by PhoneSoap; (d) to damage caused by service (including upgrades and expansions) performed by anyone who is not a PhoneSoap representative; (e) to a product or part that has been modified to significantly alter functionality or capability; (f) to consumable parts, unless expressly specified and damage has occurred due to a defect in materials or workmanship.</p>
        <p>TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THIS WARRANTY AND REMEDIES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE EXCLUSIVE AND IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, REMEDIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, STATUTORY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, PHONESOAP SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL STATUTORY OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND WARRANTIES AGAINST HIDDEN OR LATENT DEFECTS.

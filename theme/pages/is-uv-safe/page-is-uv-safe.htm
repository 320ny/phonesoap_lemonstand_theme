          <h1>Is UV Light Safe?</h1>
          <p class="enhanced">PhoneSoap Charger's UV light is completely safe for any product you put inside.</p>
          <p>PhoneSoap Charger uses UV-C light to sanitize and clean your cell phone, or whatever you choose to put inside. The question is, does this damage your electronics?</p>
          <p>Its UV light is completely safe for your gadgets. UV light can potentially cause damage with continuous, prolonged exposure to plastic. However, it would take many continuous hours of exposure to have this effect. When you close the top of PhoneSoap Charger, the UV lights will turn on for 4 minutes and automatically shut off when done. This is more than enough time to completely sanitize your phone and kill all the germs, but it is never enough time to damage your gadgets. You can feel confident your phone is safe inside, but the germs are not!</p>

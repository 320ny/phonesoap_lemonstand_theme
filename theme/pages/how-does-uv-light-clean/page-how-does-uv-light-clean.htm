          <p class="enhanced">PhoneSoap Charger uses UV light to sanitize and clean your cell phone. How does it work?</p>
          <p>There are three UV light wavelength categories: UV-A, UV-B and UV-C. The UV-C wavelength is the germicidal wavelength. UV-C utilizes short-wavelength ultraviolet radiation (shorter than UV-B and UV-A which are NOT germicidal) that is harmful to microorganisms. Let's find out how!</p>

          <strong>UV-C LIGHT DEADLY TO MICROORGANISMS</strong>
          <p>This light is effective in destroying nucleic acids and breaking apart germ DNA. With their DNA broken, they can't function or reproduce and the organism dies.</p>
          <p>UV-C that causes this germicidal effect is rare on Earth as our atmosphere blocks it. This light is harmful for our eyes, hence why it must be done within PhoneSoap's controlled environment. You will never see the UV light that is killing all those germs, but an external blue indicator on PhoneSoap Charger will let you know when your device is being sanitized. With powerful UV-C light inside, PhoneSoap has a deadly effect on microorganisms such as pathogens, viruses, bacteria and others.</p>

          <h1>History of UV and Sanitization</h1>
          <p>A brief look at history shows that UV-C sanitizing has been an accepted practice since the mid-20th century. In fact, the 1903 Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded to Niels Finsen for his use of UV against tuberculosis. It has been used primarily in medical sanitation and sterile work facilities, which means it's perfect for sanitizing mobile devices, which are especially good at harboring and growing bacteria.</p>
          <p>Your phone's warmth allows bacteria to stay alive and reproduce. UV-C light penetrates the cell and disrupts the DNA, killing the pathogen. Equally important, our UV-C light does not get hot, so while it is extremely effective at killing germs, it will not hurt your phone.</p>
